# Overview

This was made as a way for me to learn more about Rust and encryption.

Rust-Encryption is a simple program that allows the user to select an
encryption type and then enter text to be encrypted by their selection.
It then displays the encrypted message along with the clear text for
comparison to visually see the result of each encryption type.

# Development Environment

This program was written in the Atom editor using the Rust IDE extension.

- Rust/ Cargo 1.52.1
  * openssl library for encryption.
  * Hex library to format text for openssl method parameters.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* key gen.
* AES as another encryption option.
* export to file.
